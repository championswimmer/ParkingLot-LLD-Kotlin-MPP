A CLI-based parking lot (low-level-design case study) implemented 
with Kotlin Multiplatform. 

This compiles down to the following platforms 

- JVM (Java 17) - fat jar file bat/sh script to execute 
- JS (NodeJS) - single `.js` file to execute
- Native (MacOS) - single binary to execute
- Native (Linux) - single binary to execute
- Native (Windows) - single binary to execute
